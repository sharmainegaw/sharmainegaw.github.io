                <h1>One common problem I‚Äôve encountered is coming up with grocery lists.</h1>
    
                <p>Although it seems like a simple task, some users may have to plan ahead, list dishes they would like to cook, look up the ingredients needed for each dish, and then finally list them down. I wanted to help simplify that process by designing an application creates a personal grocery list for users, depending on recipes they‚Äôve chosen within the app.</p>

                <p>Moreover, I also wanted to challenge myself to learn Figma‚Äôs richer features and to practice creating assets in Figma.<p>
                
                <p>Here are the features I took into consideration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>search for recipes</p></li>
                    <li><p>add ingredients of recipes to the user‚Äôs grocery list</p></li>
                    <li><p>filter the grocery list by dish</p></li>
                </ul>

            <br class="large">
            <h2>With that in mind, I first created a design system in Figma.</h2>
    
            <p>I chose dark green as the primary color to signify health and nature, and orange as the secondary color for food. I made use of Figma's variant feature to create variants of components such as cards, buttons, as well as icons on the navigation menu. The design system was continuously updated as needed throughout the prototyping process.</p>
