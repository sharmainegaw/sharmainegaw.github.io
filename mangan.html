                <h1>One common problem I’ve encountered is coming up with grocery lists.</h1>
    
                <p>Although it seems like a simple task, some users may have to plan ahead, list dishes they would like to cook, look up the ingredients needed for each dish, and then finally list them down. I wanted to help simplify that process by designing an application creates a personal grocery list for users, depending on recipes they’ve chosen within the app.</p>
    
                <p>Moreover, I also wanted to challenge myself to learn Figma’s richer features and to practice creating assets in Figma.<p>
                
                <p>Here are the features I took into consideration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>search for recipes</p></li>
                    <li><p>add ingredients of recipes to the user’s grocery list</p></li>
                    <li><p>filter the grocery list by dish</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section-break"></div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="normal center">
            <div class="section-break"></div>
            <h2>With that in mind, I first created a design system in Figma.</h2>
    
            <p>I chose dark green as the primary color to signify health and nature, and orange as the secondary color for food. I made use of Figma's variant feature to create variants of components such as cards, buttons, as well as icons on the navigation menu. The design system was continuously updated as needed throughout the prototyping process.</p>

        <div class="bluemode">
            <div class="normal center">
                <div class="section-break"></div>
                <p>The Home screen shows recipe categories as well as a few common dishes to catch the interest of users. The difficulty level and total time to cook each dish is also shown.</p>
                <div class="text-break"></div>

                <p>Another screen is the Grocery List screen, which shows the ingredients of selected dishes, grouped by usual grocery store sections. An empty list is shown if no dishes have been selected yet.</p>
                <div class="text-break"></div>
    
                <div class="text-center">

                <div class="section-break"></div>
    
                <p>While the user is shopping, ingredients can be ticked off using the checkbox to the left of the ingredient. Same ingredients common between dishes are also combined. Ingredients can also be filtered depending on which dishes are selected. This is inspired by the filtering system used in the “Your Library” section of Spotify.</p>

                <div class="section-break"></div>
    
                <p>The Accounts screen is relatively simple. Preferences can also be found here. An option to switch check boxes to the right of the ingredients is also available, given that users may be holding something else while shopping.</p>

                <div class="text-center">

            <h1>Of course, as with all solutions, these can be improved.</h1>
            <p>One way is to enable sharing grocery lists with other people, which may be useful for people who have housemates.</p>
            <p>Overall, Figma provides rich features such as grids, auto layouts, components, and variants that makes prototyping a lot easier and allows designers to communicate their solutions effectively.</p>
