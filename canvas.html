                <br class="small">
                <h2>Canvas is a digital e-learning platform we‚Äôve been using in our university.</h2>
                <p>It‚Äôs where our professors post announcements, discussion boards, modules, lecture recording PDFs‚Äîyou name it‚Äîso one can only imagine how integral it is for remote learning. I cannot imagine not using Canvas during the pandemic, really, but after years of using it, we, a team of six, determined that a lot can still be improved.</p>
    
                <p>As with most UI/UX redesign case studies, we aimed to make the app more intuitive and provide a better experience for the users. Through this journey, I also wanted to learn the design process first-hand and its various steps.</p>

            <h1>Let‚Äôs get to work!</h1>
            <p>Although all of us in the team have first-hand experiences (and frustrations) of using Canvas, we conducted a needfinding study to find out what the problems are in Canvas through our users‚Äô perspective. We first conducted an online survey which was answered by 106 people, and also held 12 interviews remotely to get to know how exactly different users use Canvas.</p>
    
            <p>We couldn‚Äôt really cater to each user‚Äôs needs, so we created six user personas to generally represent our users. We based them off of studious they seem and how much of a power user they are when it comes to Canvas.</p>

        <br class="small">

        <div class="space-s wide slide-up">
            <h2>So what are the problems?</h2>
    
            <p>From the six personas, we identified their pain points by creating sequence models. There, we identified the flow of how users use Canvas and then identified at which step users were frustrated or stuck.</p>
    
            <p>There was a lot to unpack because of the amount of functions and features Canvas has, but we‚Äôve narrowed it down to three areas we focused on: <b>Navigation</b>, <b>Notification</b>, and <b>Assignment Preparation</b>. We then built our solutions using Google Jamboard for our first prototypes and then Figma for the next iterations.</p>

                        <li><p><b>Condense multiple sections in courses, emphasizing the Modules page.</b> This establishes uniformity across all courses, hopefully making it less confusing for users and prevent users like Achiever Alexandria from running through every section of Canvas for assignments.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Add a filter option in the Modules page </b> for situations wherein the user is looking for a certain item type, such as assignments or discussion boards. This would also allow batch downloading of files.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Add a button with download text and icon indicator</b> to the right, since the toggles for the selecting which files to download were also at the right. Both the ‚Äúdownload‚Äù text and icon were included to provide clarity. </p></li>

            <h1>Results</h1>
    
            <p>We asked the final interviewees to rate the current Canvas versus our prototypes in terms of clarity, discoverability, and manageability, and got the average. Clarity increased from 6.3 to 9.3, Discoverability from 5.5 to 9.0, and Manageability from 6.0 to 9.0.</p>
            <p>We also asked the final interviewees to self-rate their experience during usability testing using the NASA Task Load Index.</p>

            <p>All in all, we realized that what needs to improve is how information is presented such that it‚Äôs not overwhelming for users.</p>
            <p>Canvas has plenty of functionality already, and is by no means an underpowered e-learning platform. Canvas also needs to give user feedback for some of their features, like autosaving. Users‚Äô priorities also need to be taken into account‚Äîfor example, making sure they‚Äôre able to pass assignments on time, and that they‚Äôre even notified of assignments in the first place.</p>

                    <li><p>We should view the platform from the perspective of the users and <b>always</b> consider what tasks they need to accomplish using the platform.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We should build and adjust our prototypes such that it would benefit most kinds of people in the community, which is where the user personas come in.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There were still some things we could‚Äôve done better, like mine for user reviews in app stores, or by doing a comparative analysis of Canvas and other e-learning platforms in the market!</p></li>

We first conducted an online survey which was answered by 106 people, and also held 12 interviews remotely to get to know how exactly different users use Canvas.</p>
        
                <p>We couldn‚Äôt really cater to each user‚Äôs needs, so we created six user personas to generally represent our users. We based them off of studious they seem and how much of a power user they are when it comes to Canvas.</p>
        
                <br class="small">
        
                <h2>So what are the problems?</h2>
        
                <p>From the six personas, we identified their pain points by creating sequence models. There, we identified the flow of how users use Canvas and then identified at which step users were frustrated or stuck.</p>
        
                <p>There was a lot to unpack because of the amount of functions and features Canvas has, but we‚Äôve narrowed it down to three areas we focused on: <b>Navigation</b>, <b>Notification</b>, and <b>Assignment Preparation</b>. We then built our solutions using Google Jamboard for our first prototypes and then Figma for the next iterations.</p>

                <p>All in all, we realized that what needs to improve is how information is presented such that it‚Äôs not overwhelming for users.</p>
                <p>Canvas has plenty of functionality already, and is by no means an underpowered e-learning platform. Canvas also needs to give user feedback for some of their features, like autosaving. Users‚Äô priorities also need to be taken into account‚Äîfor example, making sure they‚Äôre able to pass assignments on time, and that they‚Äôre even notified of assignments in the first place.</p>
